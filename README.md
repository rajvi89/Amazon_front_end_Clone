Description

I have developed an Amazon front-end clone website as a practice project to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS. This project is a simplified replica of the Amazon website, created solely for educational purposes. It includes key features and design elements of the original site to provide a realistic user interface experience.

Please note that this is not an exact replica of the official Amazon website and does not include any backend functionality. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create a visually similar website using only HTML and CSS, without any additional frameworks or libraries.
